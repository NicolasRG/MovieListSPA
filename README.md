# MovieListSPA

Demo Live : https://moielist.appspot.com/
A small web application that keeps a list of movies. 

The UI frontend is built using React and Bootstrap 4.
The backend is written in NodeJS. 
Authentication is settup using Google's IAP service;
Storage is handled by Mongodb Atlas.

The project is configured to be hosted on Google's App Engine
(Due to this, I can not use server sent events as I wished.)
